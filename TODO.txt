* simplify all the object by using function inside the methods.. Since many methods use the same functions at the end..

* Finalize the test on the new library dataprocess (particularly on the moving average and drift issues)

* Make a format for the measures object in the javascript files and have a name for each kind of measurements. Then modify openmeasures.py to take into account this modifications while always being able to open the old files.

* Merge new_GB and density to have access to all the method at the same time.

* Redefine the OpeanMeasure with the ToSaveOnject Class to have a more coherent code.

* Integrate mayavi plot so that professional 3d histogram can be plotted (interest to assess)
